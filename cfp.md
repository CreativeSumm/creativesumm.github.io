# Call for Papers
This workshop aims to bring together researchers and promote exciting work in the domain of creative writing summarization, with the hope of contributing to the next generation of summarization systems. We welcome submissions broadly related, but not limited to:

- Abstractive and extractive summarization
- Multiple text genres (novels, biographies, plays, movie scripts, TV scripts, and other creative genres)
- Multimodal Input: Information integration and aggregation across multiple modalities (text, speech, image, video)
- Multimodal Output: Multimodal summarization including text, speech, image and video, visualization + interactive exploration, generation of tables, charts or social networks (e.g., tables of characters)
- Personalized summarization such as tailoring summaries to user queries or interests, different user backgrounds or experience, or to different devices
- Summarization using external context (e.g., influence of critical, literary or user reviews, influence of the full TV series on summarization of one episode, or of the full novel on summarization of a chapter). 
- Multilingual summarization: summarization in one language of creative documents in another.
- Semantic aspects of summarization (e.g. semantic representation, inference, validity)
- Summaries that highlight interpretations of the input
- Development of new algorithms, new datasets and annotations and new evaluation metrics
- Cognitive or psycholinguistic aspects of summarization and visualization (e.g. perceived readability, usability, etc)

## Submission Guidelines
You are invited to submit your articles through a link to be announced. All submitted papers must be anonymous for double-blind review. The content of the paper should not be longer than 8 pages for long papers and 4 pages for short papers, strictly following the COLING 2022 style template. Supplementary material and appendices (either as separate files or appended after the main submission) are allowed. We encourage code link submissions for the camera-ready version.
<br><br>
Double submissions are allowed as long as the authors make a decision before camera-ready. We will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Authors submitting more than one paper to this workshop must ensure that their submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other in content or results. Authors can submit up to 100 MB of supplementary materials separately. Authors are highly encouraged to submit their codes for reproducibility purposes.
