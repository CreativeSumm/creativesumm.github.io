# Call for Papers
This workshop aims to bring together researchers and promote exciting work in the domain of creative writing summarization, with the hope of contributing to the next generation of summarization systems. We welcome submissions broadly related, but not limited to:

- Abstractive and extractive summarization
- Multiple text genres (novels, biographies, plays, movie scripts, TV scripts, and other creative genres)
- Multimodal Input: Information integration and aggregation across multiple modalities (text, speech, image, video)
- Multimodal Output: Multimodal summarization including text, speech, image and video, visualization + interactive exploration, generation of tables, charts or social networks (e.g., tables of characters)
- Personalized summarization such as tailoring summaries to user queries or interests, different user backgrounds or experience, or to different devices
- Summarization using external context (e.g., influence of critical, literary or user reviews, influence of the full TV series on summarization of one episode, or of the full novel on summarization of a chapter). 
- Multilingual summarization: summarization in one language of creative documents in another.
- Semantic aspects of summarization (e.g. semantic representation, inference, validity)
- Summaries that highlight interpretations of the input
- Development of new algorithms, new datasets and annotations and new evaluation metrics
Cognitive or psycholinguistic aspects of summarization and visualization (e.g. perceived readability, usability, etc)
